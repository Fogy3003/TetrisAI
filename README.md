TetrisAI is an interesting reinforcement learning project. The idea is to create a model that can play itself.  
I am going to develop a couple of versions with different algorithms, input parameters, and model structures. 
I tried to implement all of my ideas in a way that everybody could copy this repository and try to use their algorithms and ideas.

You can play the game. Just run the main.py file and enjoy.
